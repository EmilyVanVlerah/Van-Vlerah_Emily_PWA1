Notes:

class is with a dot
id is with a number sign

prototype is used by adding unique things to objects inside a constructor

in the main.js you create the variables and the descriptions//add into the HTML second

in the blueprint.js you call the variable and descriptions to make the code work.//add into the HTML first

<script type="text/javascript" src = "js/main.js"></script>

 *Local variables inside a constructor do not work inside a prototype.
 *Prototypes do not allow local variables that are inside constructors to work inside itself.
 *For getElementById you can use querySelector. You have to use # like: querySelector(#id) if you are trying to get ID, otherwise no #.
 *Any object created from a constructor will automatically inherit any prototype changes, even after being created.
 *Object's link variables and functions together inside of a storage container.
